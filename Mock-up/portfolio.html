            It's 2003, several months since the US officially
            <span style="font-size: larger"> war</span> on Iraq,<br />
            and the American political world has evolved. Tensions are high,

            and the Muslim community is harassed and targeted more than ever.
            <br />Shadi, who wears hijab, her head down<br />

            She's too busy drowning in her own troubles to find the time to deal
            with bigots.<br />
            Shadi is named for joy, but she's haunted by sorrow. Her brother is
            dead, <br />
            her father is <span style="color: rgb(222, 46, 46)">dying</span>,

            mysteriously dropped out of her life. And then, of course, there's
            the small matter of her heart--<br />

            <span>It's broken</span>. Shadi tries to navigate her crumbling
            world by soldiering through, saying nothing.<br />
            She devours her own <span>pain</span>, each day retreating farther
            and farther inside herself <br />
            until finally, one day, everything changes.

            An Emotion of Great Delight is a searing look into the world of a
            single Muslim family in the wake of 9/11. It's about a child of
            immigrants forging a blurry identity, falling in love, and finding
            hope--in the midst of a modern war.
